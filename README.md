# Computer-Graphics-Images
Images of projects from the Computer Graphics course I took at RIT.  Each image reperesents a basic principle of building a custom OpenGL pipeline and becoming familiar with Computer Graphics algorithms.

## Code for Images
The code that exists for generating each of these images is being kept private out of respect for the professors at RIT.  These labs/projects tend to be reused from semester to semester for this particular course and I would not want to give anyone a way to cheat.  That being said if you are interested in how to generate each of these images yourself I would be willing to help
